Salut! My name is **Nuno Maduro**, and I am a member of the PHP community for a long time now. Last
year, I made a about **3,300 open source contributions**. And I have spoken at conferences such as
Laracon EU, PHP Serbia, ForumPHP in Paris - France, or Laravel Live India.

I have created tons of open source packages, such as **Plus**, Pest, PHP Insights, Laravel Zero,
Scout Extended, Collision, Larastan, and more.

All my work has always been released under the **Open Source license MIT**, and this will continue
into the far future. It has cost me thousands of hours to develop, test and support my open source
work.

If you find the work I do for the PHP community valuable then you can show your appreciation by
supporting me here on Patreon or Paypal. The support will be used to create new features and
everything related to make the PHP development the most enjoyable as possible.
